# End-to-end (v2.0): starts a real `lingxi1949 run --loopback` process and
# drives a real terminal session against it over iroh QUIC, using the same
# @number0/iroh binding the plugin embeds directly (doc A0 verdict).
#
# There is no relay and no `agent bind` any more - v2.0's agent has no relay
# client at all (client.rs was deleted), identity is a local keypair, and
# pairing is "copy the connection code `run` prints". This also does not
# cover file transfer: `termy/transfer/1` is Phase C and not built, so
# agent/src/serve.rs closes that ALPN with PROTOCOL_ERROR.
#
# Uses the debug agent binary - build it first with:
#   cargo build --manifest-path agent/Cargo.toml
# and make sure `pnpm install` has run, so @number0/iroh is under
# node_modules/ at the repo root.
