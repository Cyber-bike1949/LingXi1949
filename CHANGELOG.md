# Changelog

All notable changes to LingXi1949 will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.6.5] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- Expanded the Chinese and English usage guides with screenshots for drag-and-drop file transfer and one-click note transfer.
- Replaced the embedded operation video with an animated GIF so the demonstration displays and plays reliably on GitHub.

## [1.6.4] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- Added streamlined Chinese and English usage guides with screenshots and video demonstrations for local and remote terminal workflows.

### Changed
- Updated the plugin logo and applied it consistently across the ribbon, status bar, settings, note toolbar, and context menu.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-08-27

### Changed
- Reframed the community plugin description and README overview around concrete before/after pain points (note-to-terminal-AI context handoff, multi-device terminal management, repeated workflows, file-reference navigation) instead of a technical feature list, so the marketplace listing communicates value at a glance.
- Corrected the README installation section, which still said the plugin was awaiting Community Plugins directory approval — it is now listed.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-08-26

### Changed
- Renamed the public plugin display name from LingXi back to **LingXi1949**. The community plugin ID stays `lingxi-bridge` (unaffected — plugin IDs can't contain digits).

## [1.6.1] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- Changed the Obsidian community plugin ID from `lingxi1949` to `lingxi-bridge`. Plugin IDs may only contain lowercase letters and hyphens, so the digits in `lingxi1949` made it invalid.

### Changed
- Simplified the public plugin name from LingXi1949 back to **LingXi**; only the community plugin ID keeps the `lingxi-bridge` disambiguation.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-08-26

### Changed
- Renamed the plugin to LingXi1949 (Obsidian community plugin ID `lingxi1949`), replacing the `Lingxi`/`lingxi` name and ID from 1.5.0 because that name/ID was already taken. Internal protocol, binary, and service identifiers remain `termy`/`termesh` for compatibility; only the plugin's public name, ID, and repository references changed.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-08-23

### Changed
- Renamed the plugin to Lingxi (Obsidian community plugin ID `lingxi`), replacing the previous `termesh` listing. The old repository behind the `termesh` listing was deleted, which caused Obsidian's directory sync to delist the plugin; rather than fight to recover that listing, the plugin is re-launching under a new name and ID. Internal protocol, binary, and service identifiers remain `termy`/`termesh` for compatibility; only the plugin's public name, ID, and description changed.
- Updated the manifest and package description to describe the plugin's positioning: bridging Obsidian notes to AI agents with rich markdown and linked context, instead of a single flat prompt box.

## [1.4.6] - 2026-08-16

### Changed
- Download the fixed-version iroh native runtime from unpkg first, with jsDelivr and GitHub Releases as fallbacks, improving first-use reliability on networks where GitHub is slow or unavailable.
- Show native-runtime download, retry, verification, and completion progress in notices and on the connecting device card.

### Fixed
- Added bounded network timeouts and transport fallback so a stalled native-runtime download no longer leaves device pairing stuck indefinitely at zero percent.
- Verify downloaded runtime files against bundled SHA-256 hashes without making a separate checksum request.

## [1.4.5] - 2026-08-16

### Added
- Added two new ways to send a note to a connected terminal: right-click a note to send it and have the terminal's agent execute it, or use the new toolbar button in the note view. Both recursively collect every note the note links to (and their attachments), not just the note itself.
- Added a one-line remote install for the Ubuntu agent (`curl -fsSL .../install-linux.sh | bash`): it downloads and verifies the latest release binary, installs the systemd user service, and starts it, printing the connection code at the end without further manual steps.

### Changed
- Double-clicking `termy-agent.exe` on Windows now starts the agent directly (equivalent to `termy-agent.exe run`) and keeps the console window open, instead of closing immediately with a missing-subcommand error.

### Fixed
- Fixed Community Plugins and BRAT installations being unable to add remote devices. Termesh now automatically downloads and verifies the platform-native iroh runtime on first use, while complete platform packages remain available for offline installation.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed
- Updated the manifest description to satisfy Obsidian community scanner requirements.
- Added a descriptive rationale to the `no-control-regex` directive in remote path safety validation so automated source checks pass.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed
- Fixed GitHub Release creation for private repositories whose plan does not support build provenance attestations.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-07-31

### Added
- Added a responsive device home that lists the local device and paired remote devices, refreshes live connection state, and opens device-specific terminal tabs.
- Added device pairing, disconnect, and removal flows to the device home, plus a home button in every terminal.
- Added terminal titles that capture the device name and active note name when the terminal is opened.
- Added remote Relay login, device pairing and management, remote terminal sessions, and note-with-attachments transfer from the terminal view.
- Added local and remote terminal transports behind one four-channel terminal interface, with device polling and explicit offline-mode enforcement.
- Added self-service remote account registration and one-click pairing-code copy in the plugin settings.

### Changed
- Remote login sessions now survive Obsidian restarts until the Relay token expires, and remote-only device controls stay hidden in local mode.
- Successful remote transfers now report the received root note's absolute path and keep it available to copy from the terminal toolbar.

### Fixed
- Fixed Windows Agent status always reporting that the process was not running.
- Fixed macOS x64 Release builds installing the cross-compilation target into a different Rust toolchain than the pinned toolchain used by Cargo.

### Changed
- Renamed the plugin to Termesh with the community plugin ID `termesh` while retaining existing `termy` protocol and native-server compatibility identifiers.
- Moved all device management out of settings and into the device home. Settings now keeps connection and terminal configuration only.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- Fixed Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V not firing on consecutive presses while Ctrl was still held in PowerShell and other shells using win32 input mode. The same shortcut-suppression rule that previously broke repeat Shift+Enter newlines now keeps the trailing keyup of the chord suppressed but lets a fresh Ctrl+C or Ctrl+V keydown trigger another copy or paste.
- Fixed Termy's right-click menu stealing Claude Code's "right-click to paste" gesture. Active Claude Code TUI sessions now suppress the Termy menu so Claude Code's own paste fires once instead of being doubled by an extra Termy paste; other shells keep the Termy context menu, and Shift+RightClick always opens the Termy menu as an escape hatch.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- Mapped each Termy version to the minimum Obsidian version it supports so the in-app updater only offers builds that match your installation.

### Changed
- Raised the minimum Obsidian version to 1.8.7 and refreshed the plugin description to match what Termy actually does today.
- Tuned terminal appearance handling so font, theme, and renderer changes apply to every open terminal the moment you save settings, and custom background colors and images now show through reliably across the canvas, WebGL, and DOM renderers.
- Reworked home-directory resolution so paths like `~/Documents` expand correctly on every platform, including profiles where the usual environment variables are not set.

## [1.3.7] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- Added a terminal context-menu action for switching the default shell straight from an open terminal.

### Changed
- Refreshed the README version badges and the project positioning copy.

### Fixed
- Fixed the "open in file manager" action opening the parent folder after `cd <subdir>`, so cmd, PowerShell, Git Bash, and WSL terminals now open the actual current folder.
- Fixed always-on-top terminals: the pinned window now stays scoped to its own terminal, new terminals open with the normal layout, and the pinned session can be returned to the main window without restarting.
- Fixed missing lock indicators on always-on-top terminal tabs and in the terminal right-click menu.
- Fixed Claude Code terminal titles being lost after a session, and cleared stale Claude Code drag references between sessions.
- Fixed terminal context menus drifting off-screen near the edge of the pane.
- Fixed missing translations on terminal notices, and corrected the Windows shell label to `CMD`.
- Fixed preset workflow pins not staying put, and reduced reconnect churn while the plugin reinstalls in development vaults.

### Removed
- Removed the automatic plugin disable / re-enable used by the settings reload button and the development install watcher. Reloading Termy now goes through Obsidian's normal plugin settings, in line with Obsidian's developer policy.

## [1.3.6] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- Fixed newline insertion (Shift+Enter, Ctrl+Enter, Alt+Enter) not working in Codex CLI sessions running under WSL2. The modifier+Enter combinations now bypass win32-input-mode encoding and send a real newline through the bracketed paste path so TUI programs correctly interpret it as a multiline edit.
- Fixed inability to insert consecutive newlines by holding Shift and pressing Enter repeatedly. The win32 shortcut suppression flag is no longer set for newline operations, allowing key-repeat to work as expected.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Added developer scrollback reproduction scripts for comparing synchronized redraw behavior across terminals and validating Termy's compatibility layer.

### Changed
- Split generic AI TUI synchronized-output compatibility helpers out of the Claude Code support module so terminal protocol boundaries are clearer.

### Fixed
- Preserved terminal scrollback more reliably for AI TUIs that redraw on the normal buffer in xterm.js hosts, including synchronized-output redraw flows that previously purged history in Termy.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- Added a local Obsidian review lint command so community-review checks can run before publishing.

### Changed
- Updated English UI copy and README disclosures to align with Obsidian community review requirements.
- Upgraded Node type definitions to Node 20 and adjusted byte handling for stricter Buffer typing.

### Fixed
- Prevented redundant agent context snapshot writes when the active Obsidian context has not changed.
- Hardened IDE bridge message decoding and binary checksum hashing to use explicit byte handling.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- Added OpenCode as a built-in workflow launcher with a dedicated icon and context-aware integration settings.
- Added OpenCode context handoff through Termy's IDE bridge so OpenCode sessions launched from Termy can inherit the active Obsidian workspace context.
- Added development auto-reload support so `pnpm install:dev <vault-path>` can refresh the running Termy plugin after copying updated assets.

### Changed
- Changed Codex context awareness to use a Termy-managed vault-local Skill while the built-in launcher starts `codex` directly.
- Kept Claude Code and OpenCode on the IDE bridge path while documenting Codex as the Skill-based integration.
- Normalized built-in workflow definitions from current defaults so saved built-ins pick up refreshed launcher commands and icons.

### Removed
- Removed Codex MCP auto-registration, global CLI configuration mutation, and the old launch-prompt context handoff path.
- Removed the legacy context instructions file path in favor of the single live context snapshot consumed by the Codex Skill.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- Added selectable installed terminal shell programs, such as `tmux`, in terminal settings while keeping custom shell paths supported.
- Added Claude Code-aware file and folder drops that insert working-directory-relative `@path` references with safe quoting, directory trailing slashes, and trailing spacing.
- Added support for literal `file://` links in terminal output, complementing OSC 8 hyperlinks from Claude Code and other CLIs.
- Added Telegram community links in settings, README files, and generated release notes.

### Changed
- Improved Claude Code TUI compatibility by advertising Termy as an xterm.js host and handling terminal capability, extended keyboard, and OSC 52 clipboard flows expected by Claude Code.
- Improved release-note generation so generated notes use the correct changelog header format and include refreshed support links.

### Fixed
- Fixed WebSocket reconnect recovery so each open terminal recreates and rebinds its PTY session after reconnect, restoring keyboard input instead of leaving the pane attached to a stale session.
- Fixed Claude Code file hyperlinks and literal file URI output so matching files open inside Obsidian when possible.
- Fixed Claude Code drag-and-drop paths from Obsidian URIs with encoded separators and ampersands, and prevented basename-only folder drops from losing full path context.
- Fixed Windows Codex prompt redraw corruption by preventing duplicate IME/input events in Windows input mode.
- Fixed shell selection detection in Obsidian's renderer process and filtered GUI terminal apps out of the shell launcher list.
- Fixed local development install copying so plugin installs are more reliable when refreshing generated assets and native binaries.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-23

This section covers the combined changes shipped in versions `1.3.0-1.3.1`.

### Added
- Added terminal keyboard handling for multi-line `Shift+Enter`, using text insertion by default and Windows `win32-input-mode` when requested by the shell.
- Added Windows `win32-input-mode` keyboard encoding for printable keys, modifiers, navigation keys, function keys, lock-key state, and key release events.
- Added command palette actions to send the current editor selection, note content, or file path into the active terminal.
- Added clickable file references in terminal output so agent responses can open matching files directly from Obsidian.
- Added Claude Code context awareness so sessions launched from Termy can read the active Obsidian file and selection.
- Added Codex CLI context integration with optional auto-registration for the bundled `termy-context` MCP server.
- Added a server settings control to switch native binary downloads between GitHub Release and the built-in Cloudflare R2 mirror, plus a manual binary download trigger for on-demand checks and recovery.

### Changed
- Improved Windows terminal keyboard routing so PowerShell and other ConPTY-aware shells can opt into Win32 key event input instead of relying only on xterm-style input sequences.
- Reworked preset scripts into preset workflows with configurable action lists, including terminal commands, Obsidian command search, and external link actions.
- Standardized internal source comments to English across the TypeScript, CSS, and Rust codebases for easier maintenance.
- Streamlined agent handoffs by routing send and paste flows through terminal-owned APIs and focusing the receiving terminal after handoff.
- Expanded preset workflow controls with per-action enable toggles, notes, and built-in Claude Code and Codex CLI integration settings.
- Bundled the changelog into the plugin build so release notes can open reliably across BRAT and packaged installs, and moved the changelog shortcut beside the Termy title in settings.
- Added a dedicated Cloudflare R2 upload script and release workflow step so published binary artifacts are mirrored outside GitHub Releases.

### Fixed
- Merged community fix from [#3](https://github.com/ZyphrZero/Termy/pull/3) to bump the esbuild target to ES2021, preserving xterm's `requestMode()` handling and preventing TUI sessions such as Claude Code from freezing on DECRQM output, and added a bundle smoke check to catch regressions before packaging.
- Fixed a Windows keyboard handling crash while reading modifier and lock-key state for `win32-input-mode` events.
- Improved terminal drag-and-drop handling so dropped text and file paths resolve more reliably for agent and workflow launches.
- Fixed nested vault folder drags that could collapse into basename-only text such as `15040` instead of inserting the full absolute path into the terminal.
- Fixed same-name folder drags on Windows so dropped directories no longer resolve to folder-note markdown files instead of the dropped directory path.
- Updated the TypeScript project configuration away from deprecated compiler options and expanded binary download diagnostics to make update failures easier to troubleshoot.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- Added a localized drag hint key for terminal drag-to-paste interactions.
- Added a custom Termy SVG ribbon icon for opening the terminal view.

### Changed
- Updated terminal drag hint copy to a consistent message: "Drag to paste file path".
- Expanded drop payload parsing to support file entries, URI payloads, Obsidian links, and vault-relative paths.
- Updated command and ribbon labels from "Open terminal" to "Open Termy terminal".
- Improved drag hint overlay transitions for clearer visual feedback.

### Fixed
- Improved dropped file absolute path resolution on desktop via Electron `webUtils`.
- Refined drag enter/leave depth tracking to prevent stale overlay visibility during nested drag events.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- Added emoji support for preset script icons, rendered consistently across the picker, list, and status bar menu.
- Added Japanese (`ja`), Korean (`ko`), and Russian (`ru`) translations.

### Changed
- Converted English UI strings to sentence case for settings, menus, and commands.
- Replaced `Obsidian Termy` with `Termy` in UI strings and theme preview text.
- Applied theme preview and terminal appearance via element CSS variables instead of injected style tags.
- Replaced native confirm with an Obsidian modal for preset script deletion.
- Localized debug settings labels and notices.
- Updated preset script icon placeholder text to mention emoji support.
- Updated locale detection to follow the Obsidian language with base-language fallback.

### Fixed
- Switched active view lookup to `getActiveViewOfType` to avoid `activeLeaf` deprecation.
- Marked background promises as handled/voided to satisfy lint rules.
- Removed redundant assertions in preset script actions and PTY shell events.
- Updated debug logging to `console.debug` to meet console restrictions.
- Added explicit error handling when opening external links and file paths from terminal output.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- Tracked renderer type explicitly to avoid WebGL misreporting after bundling/minification.
- Added automatic fallback to Canvas on WebGL context loss with reliable state updates.
- Validated WebGL2 support to align with xterm WebGL addon requirements.

### Changed
- Replaced inline style writes with scoped style rules for terminal appearance and theme preview.
- Resolved plugin directory using `vault.configDir` instead of hard-coded `.obsidian`.
- Deferred UI setup to `workspace.onLayoutReady` for safer startup timing.
- Optimized preset script icon loading with explicit named imports to improve tree-shaking and runtime lookup.

### Removed
- Removed duplicated terminal stylesheet and generated `main.css`.
- Cleaned unused fields and imports in server/client modules and modals.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-02-05

### Added
- Added explicit PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) shell option for Windows platform.
- Added a new `pwsh` option to the shell dropdown in terminal settings.
- Added automatic fallback from `pwsh` to PowerShell 5.x when PowerShell 7 is not installed.
- Added diagnostic logging for shell detection and selection.
- Added i18n translations for the PowerShell 7 option in English and Chinese.

### Changed
- Changed plugin ID from `obsidian-termy` to `termy` to comply with Obsidian community guidelines.
- Updated npm package name from `obsidian-termy` to `termy`.
- Updated installation path to `.obsidian/plugins/termy/` instead of `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-termy/`.
- Renamed release package from `obsidian-termy.zip` to `termy.zip`.
- Reordered Windows shell detection to prioritize PowerShell 5.x for broader compatibility.

### Fixed
